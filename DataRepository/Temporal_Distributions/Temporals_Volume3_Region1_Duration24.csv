Tabulated Temporal Distribution Data,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOAA Atlas 14 Volume 3 Version 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a comma delimited file containing temporal distribution data for all four quartiles and combined cases (i.e. all cases) for the 24-hour duration.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first row of each table is the percent of duration (x-axis) which ranges from 0 to 100 percent. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first column of each table contains labels (10 to 90%) corresponding to each line on the graph which represents the cumulative probability of occurrence for the temporal distribution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The percent of total precipitation (y-axis) which also ranges from 0 to 100 percent is contained in the labeled rows. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These files correspond to the graphs presented in Appendix A.1 of the NOAA Atlas 14 documentation which can be found at: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/pfds_docs.html.  The documentation also contains other important information about these data including the number and proportion of cases in each quartile for each duration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
