Tabulated Temporal Distribution Data,
NOAA Atlas 14 Volume 1 Version 3.2,
Semiarid Southwest Convective Area,

This is a comma delimited file containing temporal distribution data for all four quartiles and combined cases (i.e. all cases) for the 6-hour duration.  ,
The first row of each table is the percent of duration (x-axis) which ranges from 0 to 100 percent. ,
The first column of each table contains labels (10 to 90%) corresponding to each line on the graph which represents the cumulative probability of occurrence for the temporal distribution.,
The percent of total precipitation (y-axis) which also ranges from 0 to 100 percent is contained in the labeled rows. ,
These files correspond to the graphs presented in Appendix A.1 of the NOAA Atlas 14 documentation which can be found at: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/pfds_docs.html.  The documentation also contains other important information about these data including the number and proportion of cases in each quartile for each duration.,
