Tabulated temporal distribution data for NOAA Atlas 14 Volume 11: Texas Region  2
This is a comma delimited file containing temporal distribution data for all four quartile cases  and for all cases combined for the 12-hour duration.

First column of each table shows time from 0 to 12 hours in 0.5-hourly increments
Second column shows cumulative percentages of total precipitation that occurred by given time in 90% of cases etc.
