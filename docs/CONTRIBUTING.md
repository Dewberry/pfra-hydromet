Contributing
----------

If you would like to contribute code in the form of bug fixes, new
features or other patches this page gives you more info on how to do so.

Git Branching Model
-------------------

Dewberry follows the standard practice of using the
``master`` branch as the main integration branch.

Git Commit Messages
-------------------

We follow the 'imperative present tense' style for commit messages.
(e.g. "Add gumbal distributions option to random sampler")

Issue Tracking
--------------

If you find a bug and would like to report it please go there and create
an issue.

Pull Requests
-------------

If you'd like to submit a code contribution please fork __pfra-hydromet__ and
send a pull request against the ``master`` branch. Like any other open
source project, we might ask you to go through some iterations of
discussion and refinement before merging.

Editing these Docs
------------------

Contributions to these docs are welcome as well. To build them on your own
machine, ensure that ``MkDocs`` is installed.
