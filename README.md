# Description

__pfra-hydromet__ is a collection of tools for developing __pluvial__ (excess rainfall) and __fluvial__ scenarios for input to hydraulic models.

### Pluvial:
These tools ([jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) ) ingest data from the NOAA Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center ([HDSC](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hdsc/index.html)) and return unique, weighted excess rainfall events suitable for use in 2D hydraulic *rain-on-grid* models. This approach relies on:

  1. Meteorological data
  2. Random sampling
  3. Hydrologic transform
  4. Convolution algorithm for grouping



### Fluvial:

These jupyter notebooks ingest [HEC-SSP](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ssp/) .rpt files containing flow frequency data for a specific USGS Stream Gage calculated at a range of confidence limits and return a series of events, statified by the annual exceedance probability, with discharge based on the mean flow frequency curve. This approach relies on:
   1. [Bulletin 17C](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/04/b05/tm4b5.pdf) flow frequency analysis
   2. Mean flow frequency curve
   3. Stratified sampling
   


__NOTE__: [EventsTable](EventsTable.ipynb) is the primary notebook for developing excess precipitation scenarios, and [SSP_to_Mean_Curve](SSP_to_Mean_Curve.ipynb) is the primary notebook for calculating the mean flow frequency curve. Both of these notebooks can be called by [*Papermill*](https://pypi.org/project/papermill/), where papermill is designed to act as a *manager* to maintain consistency in computation, and ensure cells are executed in order. *Manager* notebooks are designated with the `PM-` prefix. Executed notebooks should be saved as documentation of the inputs, outputs, and results for a given project location.

## Contents

#### __notebooks__:

##### __pluvial__:

- [__PrecipTable__](PrecipTable.ipynb): Retrieve NOAA Atlas 14 precipitation statisics for an Area of Interest (AOI).

- [__PM-EventsTable__](PM-EventsTable.ipynb): Manager notebook that executes `EventsTable` and/or `reEventsTable`.

- [__EventsTable__](EventsTable.ipynb): Calculates excess rainfall using area-averaged NOAA Atlas 14 precipitation data, temporal distributions, the curve number (CN)* transform, and a convolution reduction algorithm (grouping). The output is a set of unique, weighted excess rainfall time series.

- [__EventsTable_Stratified__](EventsTable_Stratified.ipynb): Calculates a stratified sample of runoff events given rainfall and maximum potential retention distributions. For each each event and corresponding return interval, the event weight, runoff value, maximum potential retention value, and rainfall value are calculated.

- [__reEventsTable__](reEventsTable.ipynb): Calculates the reduced excess rainfall given a user-specified stormwater removal rate and capacity. Given user-specified contributing areas (stormsheds), the lateral inflow hydrograhs are also calculated for each event.

- [__distalEventsTable__](distalEventsTable.ipynb): Calculates excess rainfall using updated randomized curve numbers and the original precipitation events calculated in `EventsTable.ipynb`. The events are combined using the groups determined during the convolution steps in `EventsTable.ipynb`. The `reEventsTable` notebook can be then be executed in order to calculate the reduced excess rainfall.

- [__JSON_to_DSS__](JSON_to_DSS.ipynb): Converts the JSON files generated by `PM-EventsTable` and/or `distalEventsTable` to a single DSS.

- [__MetadataExplorer__](MetadataExplorer.ipynb): Explores the metadata file created by `PM-EventsTable` or `distalEventsTable` during the excess rainfall calculations.

- [__Convolution_Parameters__](Convolution_Parameters.ipynb): Describes the test statistic and parameters used during the convolution step in the `EventsTable` notebook.

- `ProjectArea_ModelName_Pluvial_Parameters.xlsx `: Excel Workbook used to store the CN, stormwater removal rate and capacity, and information on lateral inflow domains for each pluvial domain within a pluvial model. This Workbook is called by `EventsTable`, `PM-EventsTable`, `distalEventsTable`, and `reEventsTable`.

##### __fluvial__:
- [__PM_Sampler_Ops__](PM_Sampler_Ops.ipynb):  Manager notebook that executes `SSP_to_Mean_Curve`, `Stratified_Sampler`, and `Make_Production_Run_List`.

- [__SSP_to_Mean_Curve__](SSP_to_Mean_Curve.ipynb): Calculates the mean flow frequency curve using [Bulletin 17C](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/04/b05/tm4b5.pdf) confidence limits calculated in [HEC-SSP](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ssp/).

- [__Stratified_Sampler__](Stratified_Sampler.ipynb): Calculates the weight of a specified number of annual exceedance probabilities/recurrence intervals uniformly selected between the minimum and maximum value within log space.

- [__Make_Production_Run_List__](Make_Production_Run_List.ipynb): Calculates the discharge for each annual exceedance probability (AEP) within the weights table using the mean flow frequency curve.

#### __DataRepository__:

- __Temporal_Distributions__: Folder containing csv files of temporal distributions of observed rainfall patterns broken down by volume, region, duration, and quartile [NOAA Published](https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/pfds_temporal.html). Note that the original data were compiled into csv's for uniform formatting.

- __Temporal_Distributions_Plots__: Folder containing a Jupyter Notebook for each NOAA Atlas 14 volume with the plotted temporal distributions for each region, duration, and quartile.

- `NEH630_Table_10_1.json`: A formatted copy of Table 10-1 from the National Engineering Handbook [Chapter 10].(https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/ftpref/wntsc/H&H/NEHhydrology/ch10.pdf.) which lists the CN values for dry and wet antecedent moisture conditions.

- `NOAA_Atlas_Volume_Codes.json`: Metadata that maps the NOAA Atlas 14 volume number to the volume code. [Source](https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/pfds_gis.html)

- `NOAA_Temporal_Areas_US.geojson`: geojson file containing the vector ploygons of the NOAA Atlas 14 temporal distribution areas. This file was constructed using the individual vector ploygons for each volume. [Source](https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/pfds_temporal.html)

- `Temporal_Distribution_Data_Map.json`: Metadata used to extract the temporal distribution data from the csv files saved within the __Temporal_Distributions__ folder.

- `Temporal_Quartile_Ranks.xlsx`: Excel Workbook that contains the percentage of precipitation events whose temporal distributions are represented by those in each quartile of a specific volume/region/duration. [Source](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hdsc/currentpf.html)


*The ([CN Method](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1044171.pdf)) is currently the only transform method in use for this project. Other transforms are available and can be adopted into the tool with minor modifications.
